# Marketing-Analytics
## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data to derive insights for enhancing marketing strategies. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and modeling to understand customer behavior and demographics.

##Key Steps
### 1.Data Loading and Preprocessing

  Loaded dataset from an Excel file.

  Handled missing values using mean or mode.

  Encoded categorical features into numerical values.

### 2.Data Visualization and Insights

  Histograms: Highlighted distribution and potential skewness of numerical features.

  Box Plot for LoyalTime: Identified outliers, central tendency, and variability.

  Correlation Matrix: Explored relationships between features:

    Positive correlation: DemAffl and TargetBuy.

    Negative correlation: DemAge and LoyalClass.

  Count Plots: Showed distribution of DemGender and LoyalClass.

  Scatter Plot between LoyalTime and DemAge: Illustrated relationship, showing general patterns.

### 3.Feature Encoding

  Converted categorical features to numerical values for modeling.

### 4.Modeling and Evaluation

  Trained a Logistic Regression model.

  Evaluated performance with a 70% accuracy score.

  Suggested improvements: feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, trying different models.
